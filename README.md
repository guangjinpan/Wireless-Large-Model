# Wireless Large AI Model
Papers related to **wireless large AI models (LAMs)** and wireless foundation models. 

Note: This paper list focuses more on **technical implementations and methodologies**. As a result, magazine or high-level overview articles are not prioritized in the initial phase of the list.

üìå **This list is continuously updated.**

Stay tuned and feel free to ‚≠ê star this repo to follow the latest progress.

ü§ù **Open to collaboration and discussion!**

I'm open to discussions and potential collaborations on LAM-based wireless research.
